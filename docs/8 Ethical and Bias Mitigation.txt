8. Ethical and Bias Mitigation:
Objective:
Implement mechanisms to address ethical concerns and mitigate biases, recognizing and rectifying biases in the data for fair and responsible decision-making.

Approach:
Bias Detection Algorithms:

Integrate bias detection algorithms. These algorithms should analyze data and model predictions to identify potential biases.
Fairness Indicators:

Implement fairness indicators. Define and monitor metrics that assess the fairness of the AI system across different demographic groups.
De-biasing Techniques:

Apply de-biasing techniques. These techniques may involve adjusting training data, modifying model parameters, or using adversarial training to reduce biases.
Ethics by Design:

Follow ethics by design principles. Ensure that ethical considerations are incorporated into the entire development process, from data collection to model deployment.
Transparency and Accountability:

Emphasize transparency and accountability. Provide clear documentation of the AI system's decision-making processes and establish mechanisms for accountability in case of unintended consequences.
