7. Explainability and Interpretability:
Objective:
Incorporate features to enhance the explainability and interpretability of the AI system, crucial for understanding decision-making processes and building trust.

Approach:
Model-Agnostic Explanations:

Implement model-agnostic explanation techniques. These methods provide insights into model predictions without relying on intricate details of the underlying model.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Conduct feature importance analysis. Determine which features contribute most to model decisions, providing a clearer understanding of the factors influencing predictions.
Visual Explanations:

Generate visual explanations. Use techniques like saliency maps or attention mechanisms to highlight regions of input data that are most influential in making predictions.
Rule-Based Explanations:

Develop rule-based explanations. Extract interpretable rules or decision trees that capture the logic of the model's decision process.
Human-Readable Output:

Ensure that the output of the AI system is human-readable. Represent predictions and explanations in a format that is easily understandable by non-experts.
