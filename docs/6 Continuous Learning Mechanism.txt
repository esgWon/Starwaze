6. Continuous Learning Mechanism:
Objective:
Develop a continuous learning mechanism for incremental learning from streaming data, adapting the AI's understanding over time without extensive retraining.

Approach:
Online Learning Strategies:

Implement online learning strategies that allow the AI system to update its knowledge incrementally as new data arrives. This is crucial for scenarios where the data distribution may change over time.
Adaptive Model Updates:

Design mechanisms for adaptive model updates. The system should be able to adjust its model parameters based on the characteristics of the incoming data.
Forgettable Memories:

Explore forgettable memory mechanisms. The system should be capable of forgetting or deprioritizing certain information over time to make room for new knowledge.
Concept Drift Detection:

Implement concept drift detection. The AI system should be able to identify when the underlying patterns in the data have changed and adapt accordingly.
Transfer Learning for Continuous Learning:

Integrate transfer learning techniques that enable the system to leverage knowledge gained from previous tasks when learning new tasks.
