10. Robustness and Security Measures:
Objective:
Build robustness and security measures into the algorithms to withstand adversarial attacks and ensure the AI system's reliability in real-world applications.

Approach:
Adversarial Training:

Implement adversarial training techniques. Train the AI system on adversarial examples to improve its robustness against malicious attacks.
Robust Model Architectures:

Design model architectures with inherent robustness. Explore architectures that are less susceptible to adversarial manipulations.
Anomaly Detection:

Integrate anomaly detection mechanisms. The system should be capable of identifying anomalous patterns or inputs that may indicate adversarial attempts.
Privacy-Preserving Techniques:

Apply privacy-preserving techniques. Ensure that sensitive information is protected, and the model does not inadvertently leak private data.
Model Validation and Verification:

Establish model validation and verification procedures. Regularly validate the model's performance and security measures to identify potential vulnerabilities.
