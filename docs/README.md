# Stargaze Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Stargaze Project! This initiative explores a multidisciplinary approach towards achieving artificial consciousness, integrating insights from neuroscience, machine learning, cognitive science, ethics, and philosophy.

## Objectives

- Develop a neural network architecture inspired by the human brain's structure.
- Simulate neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) based on deep neuroscientific understanding.
- Integrate advanced machine learning algorithms for adaptive and flexible behavior.
- Equip the AI system with advanced sensors for human-like perception.
- Emulate higher-order cognitive functions through a hybrid of neural and symbolic reasoning.
- Implement emotional intelligence simulation for recognizing and responding to human emotions.
- Establish continuous feedback loops with human interaction for ongoing learning.
- Incorporate self-improvement mechanisms for continuous evolution.
- Explore ways to simulate subjective experiences, acknowledging the challenges involved.
